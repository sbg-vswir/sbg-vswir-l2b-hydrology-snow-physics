# sbg-vswir-hydrology-snow-physics
Repository for SBG VSWIR hydrology/snow physics algorithms.

It contains source code for selected baseline algorithms as well as their theoretical basis documents (ATBDs) for the following SBG VSWIR l2b products: 
[snow fractional cover + grain size](https://github.com/sbg-vswir/sbg-vswir-l2b-hydrology-snow-physics/blob/main/docs/ATBD_snow_fractional_cover_and_grain_size.md), 
as well as [snow spectral and broadband albedo](https://github.com/sbg-vswir/sbg-vswir-l2b-hydrology-snow-physics/blob/main/docs/ATBD_snow_spectral_and_broadband_albedo.md).
