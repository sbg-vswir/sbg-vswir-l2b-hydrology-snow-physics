## 4.1 Imaging Spectrometer-Snow Albedo and Radiative Forcing (IS-SnARF)

### 4.1.1 Scientific theory

Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT and the future SBG VSWIR instruments, do not provide the measurements to allow a direct inversion of snow spectral albedo, as they measure reflected photons on their directional optical path and not from the entire hemisphere.

Retrieved L2A surface reflectance, defined as the hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), must therefore be converted to spectral albedo. IS-SnARF utilizes the relationship between HDRF and spectral albedo, referred to as the spectral anisotropy factor $c$, all of which are a function of wavelength $\lambda$:

$$
c_{\theta_r,\phi_0-\phi_v;r;\lambda} = \frac{\alpha(r;\lambda)}{HDRF(\theta_0,\theta_v,\phi_0-\phi_v;r;\lambda)} \tag{1}
$$ 

where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are zenith and azimuth angles, and the subscripts 0, r, and v signify incident, reflected, and view angles. $r$ is the snow grain radius and $\alpha$ is the snow spectral albedo as a function of $r$.

The scalar $c$ is a function of the local geometry between solar illumination and observation angles as well as snow grain size, and rearranging Equation (1) provides an estimate of the snow spectral albedo:

$$
\alpha(r;\lambda) = HDRF(\theta_0,\theta_v,\phi_0-\phi_v;r;\lambda) * c_{\theta_r,\phi_0-\phi_v;r;\lambda} \tag{2}
$$

IS-SnARF uses a comprehensive look-up-table (LUT) of pre-calculated $c$ scalars, modeled by running the multistream DISORT code (Stamnes et al., 1988; Painter et al., 2003), to obtain the respective anisotropy factor on runtime.
